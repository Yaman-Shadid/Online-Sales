# Online Sales Analysis

**Author**: Yaman Shadid

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to analyze online sales transactions across different product categories to uncover insights related to sales trends, product performance, and regional preferences. This analysis includes the application of machine learning models to predict product categories and sales volume, as well as clustering techniques to segment customers.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about online sales transactions. Each row represents a single transaction with columns for order ID, date, product category, product name, quantity sold, unit price, total price, region, and payment method.

## Methods

1. **Data Collection and Source Selection**: The data was obtained from an online sales dataset, chosen for its comprehensive coverage and relevance to the project's objectives.

2. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring the quality and integrity of the data.

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand sales trends, product performance, and regional preferences. Visualizations were created to present key insights.

4. **Machine Learning Models**:
    - **Decision Tree Classifier**: Used to predict the product category based on features like region, payment method, unit price, and quantity sold.
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor**: Used to predict the sales volume (units sold) based on features like region, product category, payment method, and unit price.
    - **K-Means Clustering**: Applied to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor**: Achieved a Mean Squared Error of 0.812 and an R^2 Score of 0.216 in predicting sales volume. The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values helps evaluate the model's accuracy.

**K-Means Clustering**: The elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and the clustering results were visualized to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.

## Recommendations

To determine the practical value of the model accuracy, stakeholders should evaluate the specific context of their application, understanding the trade-offs between precision, recall, and accuracy. Depending on the stakeholders' objectives, model parameters may need to be adjusted, or different algorithms may need to be chosen to optimize these metrics. It is advisable to work closely with domain experts to make informed decisions about model performance, especially when dealing with binary outcomes in scenarios with varying costs and class imbalances.
